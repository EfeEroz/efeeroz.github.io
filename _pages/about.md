About Me
======
I am a mechanical and aerospace engineering senior at Princeton University pursuing a computer science minor with interests in first principles-based algorithm design for computational fluid dynamics. I am currently exploring the computational modeling of three-stream turbulent, nonpremixed combustion using an optimal, on-the-fly modeling approach that I worked on with my mentor, Professor Michael E. Mueller. This algorithm generalizes conventional approaches that make asymptotic, a priori assumptions about the mixing processes between each of the fluid streams. Through this work, I practiced: Linux command-line tools and shell scripting, distributed version control with Git, typesetting with LaTeX, resource management with Slurm, high-performance computing with Fortran, and data analysis with Python. Some relevant repositories are [here](https://github.com/EfeEroz/combustion-simulation-analysis) and [here](https://github.com/EfeEroz/q2df_generalization), and the conference paper I presented at the 14th U.S. National Combustion Meeting (USNCM) in Boston, MA (March, 2025) is linked in my CV below.

I have also explored digital communication research, working on the design and Python implementation of a new, geometry-inspired forward error correction technique that can be used in place of conventional, analytical design methods to improve transmission of short messages over complex channels. I received the Princeton Shapiro Prize for Academic Excellence (awarded to the top ~4% of Princeton class) -- on campus, I am involved with Princeton Rocketry's IREC team (designing a solid-fuel rocket to reach 30,000 ft., launched in Midland, TX), Princeton Engineers without Borders (improving access to clean water in Ecuador), and, previously, the Princeton Undergraduate Research Journal (Princeton's 1st peer-reviewed, undergraduate academic journal) as the Managing Editor of Peer Review for STEM papers where I helped coordinate a review board composed of >30 Princeton undergraduates and faculty.
